Changelog for HTTP-Thin-UserAgent

0.004 2013-05-23T21:35:48
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - add back decoded_content this time as an alias

 - update README

 - bring in changes from usage at Followerwonk

 - add on_error handling and structured exceptions
   
   We add a new on_error handler that can be set to handle exceptions when
   we see them. The handler is passed a structured exception object (that
   does Throwable) but defaults to dying with just the error message.

 - s/decode/decoded_content/ to match HTTP::Message


v0.003 2013-02-18T23:43:47
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - Fix it so that the content-type is set also with add_json


v0.002 2013-02-18T23:07:26
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - Add a warning about API breakage

 - split the API out a little
   
   You'll now need to call a terminal method to get the response data
   (response, or decode currently). This is so we aren't rail-roaded into
   getting the response-as-a-perltruct when calling as_json.
