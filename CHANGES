0.003 2013-02-18T23:43:55
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - Fix it so that the content-type is set also with add_json


v0.002 2013-02-18T23:07:26
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - Add a warning about API breakage

 - split the API out a little
   
   You'll now need to call a terminal method to get the response data
   (response, or decode currently). This is so we aren't rail-roaded into
   getting the response-as-a-perltruct when calling as_json.
