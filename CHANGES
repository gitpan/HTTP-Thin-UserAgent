v0.005 2013-07-27T00:04:48
 - clean the POD up a little [Chris Prather]
 - Merge pull request #1 from perigrin/web-scraper
   
   Add Scraping functionality as well as methods for just hitting
   HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath directly. [Chris Prather]
 - add find() and tree() methods for when we want to avoid a full scraper
   [Chris Prather]

v0.004 2013-05-23T21:30:26
 - add back decoded_content this time as an alias [Chris Prather]
 - update README [Chris Prather]
 - bring in changes from usage at Followerwonk [Chris Prather]
 - add on_error handling and structured exceptions
   
   We add a new on_error handler that can be set to handle exceptions when
   we see them. The handler is passed a structured exception object (that
   does Throwable) but defaults to dying with just the error message.
   [Chris Prather]
 - s/decode/decoded_content/ to match HTTP::Message [Chris Prather]

v0.003 2013-02-18T23:43:47
 - Fix it so that the content-type is set also with add_json [Chris
   Prather]

v0.002 2013-02-18T23:07:26
 - Add a warning about API breakage [Chris Prather]
 - split the API out a little
   
   You'll now need to call a terminal method to get the response data
   (response, or decode currently). This is so we aren't rail-roaded into
   getting the response-as-a-perltruct when calling as_json. [Chris
   Prather]
